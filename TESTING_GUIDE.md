# HR Chatbot Testing Guide

## Current Status: ✅ Ready for Testing

The HR chatbot has been successfully updated with improved Streamlit Cloud secrets handling and comprehensive debugging information.

### 🔍 What the Debug Info Will Show

When you run the application, you'll see detailed debugging information that helps identify:

1. **Streamlit Secrets Object Type** - How Streamlit is handling secrets
2. **Available Secret Keys** - What secrets are actually loaded
3. **Multiple Access Methods** - Different ways to access each secret:
   - Direct attribute access (`st.secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY`)
   - Dictionary access (`st.secrets.get("OPENAI_API_KEY")`)
   - Lowercase versions (`st.secrets.get("openai_api_key")`)
4. **Environment Variables** - What's available from the system
5. **Combined Results** - Final resolved values used by the application

### 🎯 For Streamlit Cloud Deployment

**Configure these secrets in your Streamlit Cloud app settings:**

```toml
OPENAI_API_KEY = "your-actual-openai-api-key"
PINECONE_API_KEY = "your-actual-pinecone-api-key"
PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT = "your-pinecone-environment-region"
PINECONE_INDEX_NAME = "your-pinecone-index-name"
```

**Steps to add secrets in Streamlit Cloud:**
1. Go to your deployed app on Streamlit Cloud
2. Click the gear icon (⚙️) to access settings
3. Navigate to the "Secrets" tab
4. Paste the TOML configuration above with your actual values
5. Save the secrets
6. The app will automatically restart and pick up the new secrets

### 🧪 Testing Checklist

### 🔧 Troubleshooting

If you see "NOT FOUND" for any secrets:

1. **Double-check secret names** - They must match exactly (case-sensitive)
2. **Verify TOML format** - Use quotes around values
3. **Check for typos** - Secret keys must be exact
4. **Restart the app** - After adding secrets, restart the Streamlit app
5. **Check the debug output** - It will show exactly what's found vs. missing

### 🚀 Production Ready

Once testing is complete and all secrets are working:

1. Remove the debug sections from `streamlit_app.py`
2. Update the README with deployment instructions
3. The application will be production-ready!

### 📞 Support

If you encounter issues:
- Check the debug output first
- Verify your API keys are valid
- Ensure your Pinecone index exists or can be created
- Review the Streamlit Cloud logs for any errors

The application now has robust error handling and multiple fallback methods for accessing secrets, making it much more reliable for cloud deployment! 🎉
